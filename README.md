***Note: this package is still actively changing and not yet on Nuget.org. Please wait for v1.0 before using it.***


MdView is a highly customisable framework for rendering Markdown as native Xamarin.Forms components.

MdView's default controls are designed to be easily replaced with your own custom ones, to better match the design of your app and add additional functionality.

| Default Xamarin Theme | Dark Google Material Theme | Dynamic Editing of Markdown |
